# Data Analysis on movies.
## In this repository we try to answer some movie questions using data from a dataset with 3200 movies.
### We use python as well as some popular python tools for our purposes:
* pandas for data manipulation.
* seaborn for data visualization.
* scikit learn and scipy for statistical analysis.
